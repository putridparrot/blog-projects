# blog-projects

_Important: Whilst all projects here worked at the time of committing/pushing, over time I will be merging security/vulnerability/fixes PR's from Dependabot and will not always have time to verify the new versions of libraries still work with mmy code._

This repository is used to store test/sample projects related to my blog posts (http://www.putridparrot.com/blog). 

* Drag and Drop behaviour in WPF see post http://putridparrot.com/blog/a-wpf-dragdrop-target-behavior/
* Added code to demonstrate use of Vert.x see posts http://putridparrot.com/blog/category/vert-x/
